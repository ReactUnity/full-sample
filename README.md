# React Unity Development Sample

This repo is used for developing and manually testing ReactUnity. However, it contains many examples that can be useful for users of ReactUnity. 

There is also a simpler sample project, see https://github.com/ReactUnity/samples.

## How to Use

Open the project in Unity. Open MainScene and click Play. Navigate the examples in rendered UI.

To make changes to the UI:

- Go to `<ProjectRoot>/react`
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` from this folder
- Make changes to React files (e.g. `src/pages/home/index.tsx`)
- Click "Play" in Unity. The changes you make to the source code will be automatically applied to the UI.

See the [main project](https://github.com/ReactUnity/core) for further instructions.
